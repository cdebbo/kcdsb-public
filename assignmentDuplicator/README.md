Assignment Duplicator

A Google App to help teachers create copies of assignments for students.

Teachers often want to share an assignment or test with their students. Sharing a file with multiple students allows all the students to edit one file. What teachers often need is a copy of the file for each student.

This app does that.

The teacher selects the file they wish to duplicate and they select a class. This app creates a unique copy of the file for each student and places that file in a new folder in the teachers Google drive. 
The students now have their own copy of the file and the teacher has full access to all the files.
